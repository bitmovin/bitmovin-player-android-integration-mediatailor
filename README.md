## Supported features & workflows
### Stream types
- HLS Live
- Dash Live
- HLS VOD
- DASH VOD
### Beaconing
This integration utilizes MediaTailor's [client-side tracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/ad-reporting-client-side.html) for ad tracking data. This integration will handle the sending of the ad beacons provided by MediaTailor's client-side tracking JSON.
Automatically tracked events:
- [PlayerTrackingEvents](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/blob/main/mediatailor/src/main/java/com/bitmovin/player/integration/mediatailor/api/TrackingEvent.kt)
- [LinearAdTrackingEvents](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/blob/main/mediatailor/src/main/java/com/bitmovin/player/integration/mediatailor/api/TrackingEvent.kt)

It's also possible to manually send tracking events using [MediaTailorSessionManager.sendTrackingEvent](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/blob/main/mediatailor/src/main/java/com/bitmovin/player/integration/mediatailor/api/MediaTailorSessionManager.kt)
Check out [TrackingEvent](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/blob/main/mediatailor/src/main/java/com/bitmovin/player/integration/mediatailor/api/TrackingEvent.kt) to see which events are supported.

## Limitations
- No support for companion ads
- No support for the Bitmovin player playlist feature

# Getting started
Follow the [getting started guide](https://developer.bitmovin.com/playback/docs/getting-started-android) to integrate Bitmovin player into your project.
### Gradle configuration
Include Bitmovin's Maven repository in your `settings.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://artifacts.bitmovin.com/artifactory/public-releases")
        }
    }
}
```
Include the MediaTailor integration in your `build.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.bitmovin.player.integration:mediatailor:0.1.2")
}
```
## Examples
### Basic session initialization
To create a session and load the stream into the player:
```kotlin
val player = Player(context)
val mediaTailorSessionManager = MediaTailorSessionManager(player)
scope.launch {
    val sessionResult = mediaTailorSessionManager.initializeSession(
        MediaTailorSessionConfig(
            sessionInitUrl = "https://example.com/mediatailor/session-init.m3u8",
            assetType = MediaTailorAssetType.Linear(),
        )
    )
    when (val sessionResult = sessionResult) {
        is Success -> {
            player.load(SourceConfig.fromUrl(sessionResult.manifestUrl))
        }
        is Failure -> {
             // Handle session initialization failure
        }
    }
}
```
Once the session is no longer needed, you can stop it. Always stop the session before initializing a new one.
```kotlin
mediaTailorSessionManager.stopSession()
```
Destroy the session manager when it's no longer needed. After this call, the session manager cannot be used anymore.
Destroying the session manager automatically stops the active session, so there is no need to call `stopSession()` before calling `destroy()`.
```kotlin
mediaTailorSessionManager.destroy()
```
### Event system
`MediaTailorSessionManager` provides an event system based on [Kotlin's Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) to subscribe to session events.
Check out [MediaTailorEvent](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/blob/main/mediatailor/src/main/java/com/bitmovin/player/integration/mediatailor/api/MediaTailorEvent.kt) to see all available events.

For example, to log all `MediaTailorEvent.Info` events:
```kotlin
mediaTailorSessionManager.events.filterIsInstance<MediaTailorEvent.Info>().collect {
    Log.d(TAG, it.message)
}
```

Check out the [app module](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-integration-mediatailor/tree/main/app) for an example implementation.
